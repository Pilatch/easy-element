Test for build failure error messages, such as:
  css syntax error when not using preprocessor

Better compiled output without multiple "use strict" and other nonsese.

Error message test for a building a css file without specifying a preprocessor,
and it blows up on syntax error.

Maybe include JS outside the element's class?

Make one demo page that lets you write codez that are shared between
es5 and class-based components so you don't have to duplicate stuff.
