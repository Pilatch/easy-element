Demo page should respect the bundle flag too

Test for build failure error messages, such as:
  trying to build a file that does not exist
  building with the wrong preprocessor

Better compiled output without multiple "use strict" and other nonsese.

Build and watch folders that keep component files at varying depths?

Fail on CSS syntax errors in non-preprocessor land?
