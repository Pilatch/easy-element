Test for build failure error messages, such as:
  css syntax error
  trying to build a file that does not exist
  building with the wrong preprocessor

Better compiled output without multiple "use strict" and other nonsese.

Error message test for a building a css file without specifying a preprocessor,
and it blows up on syntax error.
